<p>I'm a news apps consultant and data journalist with a background in machine learning and local investigations. You can find a <a href="https://bxroberts.org/work/" title="My recent work page">list of my best projects here</a> and my <a href="http://bxroberts.org/files/brandon-roberts-resume.pdf" title="Brandon Roberts Resume">resume here</a>. I'm based in the Seattle area and am currently working as a freelancer specializing in the intersection of data journalism, digital media and strict deadlines. My recent consulting work includes ProPublica, where I've worked on <a href="https://www.propublica.org/electionland/" title="Electionland -- ProPublica">Electionland</a>, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/" title="ProPublica - Nonprofit Explorer">Nonprofit Explorer</a> and built <a href="https://github.com/propublica/django-collaborative" title="Django Collaborative - GitHub">Collaborate</a>, an open source tool to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/nerds/collaborative-journalism-project-building-tools-to-help" title="Want to Start a Collaborative Journalism Project? We’re Building Tools to Help.">enable collaborative journalism</a>. I've also done projects with the Associated Press, the <a href="https://membershipguide.org/" title="The Membership Guide">Membership Puzzle Project</a>, New Zealand Department of Conservation, <a href="https://data.dictatoralert.org/" title="Dictator Alert">Dictator Alert</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180108055608/https://www.bythebay.cool/" title="By The Bay - Archive from January 2018">By The Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from my consulting work, I've worked with local nonprofit newsrooms, <a href="http://bxroberts.org/2019/02/autoscrape-research-paper/" title="Robust Web Scraping in the Public Interest with AutoScrape (Research Paper)">developed a next-generation web scraping tool</a> and presented research at <a href="http://cplusj.org/">Computation + Journalism Symposium 2019</a>). If you're a journalist have have a story you think requires machine learning to report, <a href="/bio/#contact">contact me</a> - I'm always looking to collaborate.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, I was a data journalist at <a href="http://www.theaustinbulldog.org" title="The Austin Bulldog"><em>The Austin Bulldog</em></a>, an investigative non-profit based in Austin, Texas. I wrote tools to automate routine investigative tasks like full background investigations of political candidates, scraped large datasets, and wrote distributed grid searches. I led research on a 6-month local tax-evasion story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151004213528/http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=266:homestead-exemptions-rife-with-abuse&amp;catid=3:main-articles" title="Homestead Exemptions Rife With Abuse">(part1)</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329231301/http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=268:homestead-exemptions-a-tax-loophole&amp;catid=3:main-articles" title="Homestead Exemptions a Tax Loophole">(part2)</a>. Our work resulted in the recovery of hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes and the closing of the tax loop-hole. This is when I first saw the power of applying <a href="http://artificialinformer.com" title="Artificial Informer Issue 1">new techniques to old journalistic problems</a>. That same year I was a finalist in the <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/cir-prospect">CIJ/IRE’s "Follow the Money"</a> campaign finance data mining contest and I spoke at <a href="http://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar-2013/">NICAR 2013</a> in Louisville, KY. I slept on the roof of an abandoned building on the first night. Then it snowed.</p>
<p>When I'm not near a computer, you can usually find me at <a href="http://wa2600.org">Seattle 2600</a> or walking my rescue pitty, <a href="/files/kisses.jpg">Kisses</a>, and her other adopted siblings.</p>
